# GoDB

GoDB is a project that I am building just to learn Go

## Installation

You need to use [go compiler](https://go.dev/dl/) to compile the application.

The main class is under the package `cli/cli.go`.



To compile:

```bash
go build cli/cli.go
```

## Running

To run the compiled file

```bash
#windows
cli

#linux
./cli
```
 Or just run directly:

```bash
go run cli/cli.go
```
